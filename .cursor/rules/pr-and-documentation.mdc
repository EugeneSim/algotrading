# PR and Documentation Standard

All code or config changes in this repo must be delivered as a **Pull Request** with clear explanation and documentation.

## Pull Request Requirements

- **Title**: Short, imperative (e.g. "Fix look-ahead in backtest signal alignment", "Upgrade pandas calls to non-deprecated API").
- **Description**:
  - What changed (files and high-level behavior).
  - Why (bug, robustness, security, deprecation, or feature).
  - How it affects backtesting, paper trading, or other workflows if relevant.
- **Scope**: One logical change per PR when possible; group related edits (e.g. one “Deprecation fixes in backtest stack”) if they belong together.

## Documentation Updates

- **Code**: Update docstrings for new or modified public functions/classes (purpose, args, returns, notable side effects).
- **Project**: Update `README.md` or `docs/` when:
  - Dependencies or setup steps change.
  - New scripts or entrypoints are added.
  - Backtest or run instructions change.
- **Changelog**: For larger releases, consider a short changelog (e.g. in README or `docs/`) listing notable fixes and upgrades.

When suggesting or applying changes, always provide the PR-style title and description and note any doc files to update.
